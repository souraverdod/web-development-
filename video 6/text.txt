CLS: Cummulative Layout Shift 
defintion: how much shift in layout while loading the details

 simply mean whenever other layout is loaded then there should not any shift 
in there  
                                  OR
simply mean First you click on something and then the other layout came in front of you and 
now you don't have any back button as because the 2nd layout is over lapping onto the first layout 
                                  OR 
CLS  is the thing which posses the beauty of the webpage and improve the experience for the user 
as i clicked so button mistakenly and I want to go back but the next layout instead of open side wise 
or blow the page it opened over the page and now you can't go back because the back button was on 
the last layout which you mistakenly clicked 
this distorts the user experience 

LCP:
What is LCP?
The Largest Contentful Paint (LCP) metric reports the render time of the largest image or text block 
visible within the viewport, relative to when the page first started loading.
to provide a good user experience a website should load within 2.5 second for a best LCP score 

What is FID?
FID measures the time from when a user first interacts with a page (that is, when they click a 
link, tap on a button, or use a custom, JavaScript-powered control) to the time when the browser
is actually able to begin processing event handlers in response to that interaction.

What is a good FID score?
To provide a good user experience, sites should strive to have a First Input Delay of 100
milliseconds or less. To ensure you're hitting this target for most of your users, a good 
threshold to measure is the 75th percentile of page loads, segmented across mobile and 
desktop devices.

there are lot of other web vitals but these three are irreplacable but other get changes
